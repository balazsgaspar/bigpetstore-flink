# bigpetstore-flink


# ABSTRACT for flink-con


"The ASF BigTop BigPetStore project consists of a set of distinct but interrelated software applications which generate synthetic, realistic workloads using a highly dynamic data generator as a common backbone.    The initial version was built on top of MapReduce, and, more recently, Spark.  The BigPetStore-Flink project demonstrates the notable differences between Flink and other data processing APIs by focusing on streaming analytics on data at large scale (5,000 transactions per second or higher), and can represents a common, open source Flink reference application which will be curated as part of the ASF BigTop family of BigPetStore implementations."
